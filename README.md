> Update order payment status when refunded in Stripe

Asynchronous microservice that is triggered by [Stripe](https://stripe.com) webhooks to update Order data inside of [moltin](https://moltin.com).
Built with [Micro](https://github.com/zeit/micro)! ü§©

## **Prerequisite**

NOTE: when making calls to 'moltin.Orders.Payment', please ensure payload contains 'metadata' containing order and customer data

```
const payload = {
    gateway: 'stripe',
    method: 'purchase',
    payment: stripeSource.id, // The Stripe source (refunds don't work on tokens)
    options: {
        customer: stripeCustomer.id  // The Stripe customer ID (required as sending source instead of token above)
```

            metadata: {
                order_id: moltinOrder.id
            }

```
    }
};

return moltin.Orders.Payment(moltinOrder.id, payload) ...
```

## üõ† Setup

Both a [moltin](https://moltin.com) _and_ [Stripe](https://stripe.com) account are needed for this to function.

Create a `.env` at the project root with the following credentials:

```dosini
MOLTIN_CLIENT_ID=
MOLTIN_CLIENT_SECRET=
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=
```

Find your `MOLTIN_CLIENT_ID` and `MOLTIN_CLIENT_SECRET` inside of your [moltin Dashboard](https://dashboard.moltin.com)'s API keys.

Find your `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` inside of your deployed endpoint within Stripe's [Webhook Settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks) area.

Find your `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` within Stripe's [API Settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/apikeys).

### üì¶ Package application and start the server

Run the following command to build the app

```bash
yarn install
```

Start the development server

```bash
yarn dev
```

The server will typically start on PORT `3000`, if not, make a note for the next step.

### Expose the service

This will expose PORT `3000` to the outside world.

Start ngrok (change ngrok port below from 3000 if yarn dev deployed locally on different port)

```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

Make a note of the https 'URL' ngrok provides.

## ‚õΩÔ∏è Usage

Next head over to the Stripe [Webhook Settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks) area, add a new webhook with the following details:

```
'URL to be called': <ngrok URL above>

'Webhook version': '2018-05-21 (Default)'

'Filter event': 'Select types to send' > 'charge.refunded'
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Each time a `charge` is `refunded` this function will be called, but it will only call moltin to update order if 'fully refunded' in Stripe (TODO: if Moltin add support for order.payment = partial_refund then can update to handle).

## üöÄ Deploy

You can easily deploy this function to [now](https://now.sh).
